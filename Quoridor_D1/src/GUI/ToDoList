To Do List - GUI

Walls:
1. MouseReleased: Alignment of the wall to its right place

2. Valid wall movement:
    intersects with other walls
    was it the player's turn?
    is there a path for both players to win?
3. How to change the neighbors of the cells?

Maybe have the Board a property in the wall class?? Maybe waste of memory?
